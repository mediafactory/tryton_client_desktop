Menu Bar
^^^^^^^^
The menu bar is the main control unit. It provides most of the functionalities
of the client application. The menu bar is grouped into categories. It is
controlled with mouse or keyboard. The `menu bar items`_ are explained later.


Mouse and Keyboard use
++++++++++++++++++++++
Most functions of the Tryton client can be used with mouse or keyboard.
`Key bindings`__ for all menu items are preset. Furthermore all key bindings
are manually configurable. To change the binding of a menu item the user needs
to put the cursor onto it and simply press the user defined key combination.
Usually key bindings are composed with modifier keys.

__ Menu-Help-Keyboard_Shortcuts_

Additionally the menu bar items are accessible with the *Alt* or *Option* key.
The user needs to hold the *Alt* or *Option* key followed by the underlined
character of the menu bar item to choose. To dive into deeper menu levels,
he needs to release the *Alt* or *Option* key and to simply press the
underlined letter of the sub menu item.

.. Warning:: Beware to hold the *Alt* or *Option* key on diving into sub menus.
   It will actually change the key binding for this menu item!

The second mouse button (usually right mouse button) provides an additional
contextual menu for some views and fields. In this context menu the user finds
:term:`actions` to copy and paste contents or setting up default values or
selections for several fields.

Drag and drop is provided for arranging tabs.


Tool Bar
^^^^^^^^
The tool bar contains some often used menu functions mapped to icons.

:TODO: Create a menu item for attachments and move the following paragraph
   to the menu item

In addition to the menu bar the tool bar contains a button called
*Attachment*. The attachment item handles the document management system of 
Tryton which is able to attach files to an arbitrary :term:`model`. The button
has two functions. It is showing how many attachments are linked to the 
current view. On click it opens the attachment :term:`dialog`. This dialog 
has the following layout:

* Preview: Show a preview picture of the selected attachment
* Description: Show and edit free text description for the selected attachment
* Attachment list: Show and select all attachments for the given resource
* Actions:

  - Save Text: Save the description text to the selected attachment.
  - Add File...: Add a file as attachment. A file dialog opens.
  - Add Link...: Add a link to a file as attachment. A file dialog opens.
  - Save as...: Save the selected attachment to the local file system.
  - Delete...: Delete the selected attachment.
  - Close


Tabbed Main Frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This part of the client contains all the related contents and
functions provided by the :term:`Tryton server` :term:`modules`.
All aspects inside the *main frame* depend at least on the individual set
of installed modules.

The main frame provides a `tabbed document interface`__ to arrange different
views side by side. New :term:`tabs` are opened by special :term:`actions`,
like choosing a menu item or clicking some action buttons. All tabs include
titles which show the name of the provided view.

__ TDI_

.. _TDI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface

.. Note:: Inside :term:`views` there could be tabs, too.

Main Menu
+++++++++
The first left tab contains the *main menu* (... not to mix up with
the menu bar!). The *main menu* does not contain fixed menu items.
All of them are dynamically provided by the actual set of the installed
:term:`modules` depending on the access rules of the current user. If a menu
item is clicked, the appropriate action will open in a new tab. As the figure
below illustrates, the *main menu* is split up in three frames.

The upper left frame contains the first or top level entries of the *main 
menu*. Standard top level entries are 'Administration' and 'Tryton'. 

.. note:: The *administration* menu will be explained in the modules 
   documentation for the 'IR' module, the *information repository*. 

The top level entry 'Tryton' connects to the website of the Tryton project.

The right frame is showing a :term:`tree view` substructure of menu *items*
and *headings*. With the arrow keys it is possible to navigate inside the menu.
By pressing *Enter* or double-clicking onto the menu item the appropriate
:term:`views` opens. Using left and right arrow to expand or contract sub 
items of a heading.

      |________________________________________________________|


The lower left menu frame shows a user adjustable *shortcuts* menu. This menu
is for collecting often used menu items. Using a *shortcut* item will open
the appropriate view in a new tab, just with a double mouse click.
A menu item is added to the *shortcut* menu by pushing the plus button [+]
in the *shortcut* menu. The minus button [-] in conjunction with a selected
*shortcut* item removes it from the *shortcut* list.

Home Action
+++++++++++
Another tab opens during the startup of the Tryton client: the home action. 
It is usually an item of the `Main Menu`_ which opens, when the user call his 
`Home`__ action defined in the `preferences`__.

__ Menu-Form-Home_

__ Menu-User-Preferences_

Status Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Tryton client provides two layers of *status lines*. One for the whole
client application, called *client status line* and one for the :term:`views`
residing in :term:`tabs`, called *view status line*.


Client Status Line
++++++++++++++++++
The client status line provides general informations of the state of the
Tryton client. It is divided in three parts.

* On its left side are details of the server connection shown including 
  database and user informations if connected. It is also noted there, if 
  there is no connection to a Tryton server at all. The left side information 
  of the client status line is build with the following pattern::

    <user-name>@<tryton-server-address>:<port>/<database-name>

* In the center the real name of the Tryton user is shown.
* The right side of the client status line provides informations about open
  requests for the actual user. There is also a button to create and to
  find allocated requests.


View Status Lines
+++++++++++++++++

Each tab has a separate *view status line* at the bottom, just above the 
client status line. The status line for :term:`views` in each tab inform on 
the one hand about the actual *position* (sequence) of the selected record and
on the other hand about the total count of records in the corresponding 
:term:`tree view`. The *id number* of the selected record is shown in 
parantheses. The view status line is build by the following pattern::

  Record: <pos> / <count> (id: <id>)


Menu Bar Items
**************
The following section describes the function of each menu bar entry in detail.
A rule of thumb: All items of the menu bar that are suffixed by three dots 
(...) will open an intermediate :term:`dialog` for setting up the provided 
menu action. Most dialogs provides a *Cancel* button, used to stop the 
complete dialog process.


File
^^^^
The file menu level provides functions about Tryton server login,
Database maintenance and closing the client application.

.. _Menu-File-Connect:

Connect...
  By choosing this menu entry the client will be connected to an available 
  Tryton server. A :term:`dialog` opens to request credentials:

  * `Server`__
  * Database: Database to connect server side
  * User name: Tryton user name to login
  * Password: Tryton password to login
  * Actions:

    - Connect: Connects to the server with the given credentials.
    - Cancel

.. note:: Depending on server configuration for session timeout, the actual
   user may be logged out of the current session, and need to login again.
   Default timout for logging out is six minutes.

__ File-Server-Connection_


.. _Menu-File-Disconnect:

Disconnect...
  Disconnects the client from an active server connection. In case of unsaved
  changes in an open tab, the Tryton client will request for saving the 
  changes.

Database
++++++++
This menu level provides tools to maintain Tryton databases.
For all database operations the user needs to know the Tryton server password.

.. warning:: Concider not to use this server-site maintaining functions 
             if there are security concerns. Since there are always security 
             concerns in a multiuser environment, better disclaim to provide 
             this functions on database level. 

.. note:: Postgres database names are restricted by some rules:

          * Allowed characters are alpha-nummeric [A-Za-z0-9] and
            underscore (_).
          * First character must be an alphabetic letter.
          * The maximum length of a database name is 64 characters.

          Tryton automatically checks if the given database name follows
          the rules.

.. _Menu-File-New_Database:

New Database
  Opens a :term:`dialog` for creating a new Tryton database with an initial
  user called *admin*.
